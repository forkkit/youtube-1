I later talked to another trekker who attempted this section. He got further by scrambling over rocks in the river gully, only to find the pass impossible the next day - he too ended up calling a helicopter. I made contact with one trekker (Suvi) who successfully completed this section, and I've integrated their InReach track into the route. Suvi was tracking using an InReach which drops a GPS location only once every ten minutes, so the route from here until Yangla Kharka is rather rough. Suvi reported that the trail is extremely tricky to follow with sections of bushwhacking. If you successfully complete this section, please record an accurate GPS log and I'll improve the route (dave@brophy.uk)."

After that we found a dirt road, but a major navigational blunder meant we missed the correct trail Sano Jyandan. We didn't stay at Sano Jyandan, so the rating is for the guesthouse we stayed at in Madre. However, I have left the route going via Sano Jyandan and I would recommend you try to follow it.

      "Notes": "We had major problems here. The route before the Langtang Khola crossing is very wild - no trail on the ground and often bushwhacking through dense shrubland. Moving through this terrain is slow and frustrating. We descended the Langshisha Khola from the campsite on the west moraine towards Langshisha Kharka. This was a bad decision because the only bridge over the Langtang Khola was on the east side of the Langshisha Khola. We spent most of the day bushwhacking back up the Langshisha Khola through dense shrubland to find a safe place to cross, only to give up and return to Langshisha Kharka to camp overnight. We continued searching early the next morning, hoping the water would be lower. It was noticeably lower but still too dangerous to cross. Our party split up, and the two others managed to cross the Langshisha Khola nearer the glacier. Mathi and I eventually made a very dangerous crossing of the Langtang Khola assisted by a rope. We were swept away by the fast flowing river and dragged to safety by the others on the opposite side. This was a really bad idea and not recommended in the slightest. I have updated the route to immediately descend from the camp site and cross the Langshisha Khola as soon as possible. From there, it continues down on the east side to the bridge. This is not the route we hiked, so be aware this is just a suggested route. Also be aware that this was the situation in spring 2019, and the bridge may have been changed. Also with less water in the river this could have been a completely different experience. After you cross the Langtang Khola to the north bank you pick up the Langtang trail which is well maintained and easy to follow."

I believe the best way would have been to continue towards Chharka Bhot on the west bank after crossing the Thansan Khola. I would recommend doing this, and have left the route going this way to Chharka Bhot even though we didn't go this way. We made the decision to hike up the Yalku Khola, heading towards one of the passes near Chharka Bhot. The upper parts of the Yalku Khola were not passable, and the pass we were aiming for didn't look safe at all. We changed plans several times, and ended up hiking for two days over mountainous terrain with no trails on the map or the ground. The route we took skipped Chharka Bhot entirely and continued directly west across the mountains to the Chap Chu East waypoint, camping overnight at Sipalun Kharka. This part of the route was relatively easy with no particularly dangerous terrain. However, the problem is that you arrive at Chap Chu on the east side of the Bharbun Khola. There is no bridge and when we were there (August 16th) the river was far too swollen to cross. After taking advice from some Yak herders, we followed a rough trail south to Sinjik expecting the water to be lower, however this was incorrect and in fact the water was higher. Sinjik was deserted with a few derelict buildings, and as far as we could see the path finished there and we couldn't go any further south. We were out of options and about to give up when a local man appeared and led us along the most perilous trails I've ever hiked in my life. Slippery rocks with certain death falls inches away. I would highly recommend not trying to repeat this route! After a couple of hours we arrived in Thinmer where we stayed overnight in a basic homestay. Thinmer has a bridge over the Bharbun Khola, and the trail north to Chap Chu on the west side of the river was safe and well maintained. If you would like our detailed GPS tracks for this route, you can find them in our raw GPX logs (days 123-126), however be warned that the section from Sinjik to Thinmer was exceedingly dangerous and I would absolutely not repeat it myself."

There is no trail shown on digital maps, which usually indicates the trail on the ground is tenuous or non-existent. The guidebook mentions there are several crossings of the Bharbun Khola required with no bridge. We only saw that river south (downstream) of Chap Chu, but I would expect crossing it would have been impossible even further upstream when we were there (August 16th). The guidebook and paper maps mention an alternative trail that takes a more remote northerly route from Chharka Bhot to Dho Tarap via Mola La (5030m) and Jhyarkoi La (5360m). I suggest you talk to locals at Chharka Bhot and work out the best option considering the current conditions. It may be possible to arrange a local guide - I would highly recommend that. Again I must stress that I believe this leg would have been impossible when we were here (August 16th) due to the river being too swollen. If you find a reliable, safe route through this section, please contact me (dave@brophy.uk) because I would love to use your GPS tracks and trail notes here."

If I was to hike this leg again I'd try aiming for the leftmost chorten and hope that the trail continues all the way to the ridge. When we reached the ridge, we found a trail that seemed to come from the south from the general direction of Pho, so I believe this was an easier route. However the terrain was relatively open so the section of bushwhacking didn't post any significant dangers. I have left the route following our track. If you find a better route through this section, please contact me (dave@brophy.uk) because I would love to use your GPS track. Once we reached the ridge, we found a trail that was relatively easy to follow. Take note of the waypoint that marks the descent from the ridge because it may be easy to miss."

We missed a trail and continued hiking down the Chyandi Khola directly next to the river. As we continued the banks became increasingly steep and we had to pass increasingly dangerous obstacles to continue following the river. As the number of perilous situations we encountered grew, the prospect of backtracking through them again seemed more and more problematic. In the end, it was impossible to continue, and we made the decision to climb out of the river gorge up a steep bank. This was utterly idiotic and could have easily cost us our lives. We had no idea what was above us, and the terrain was so steep that we were basically rock climbing with no safety equipment. When we reached the top of the ridge, we found a well trodden trail that led down to a bridge over the Kaitpuchonam Khola. Neither of us were in any mood for more adventures, so we camped as soon as we crossed the bridge. I have adjusted the route to follow where I'm guessing the trail comes from, but be aware that we completely missed it, so this is very approximate. We completed the rest of this leg to Takla Khola the next day, which was tricky to follow and very steep in places."

We were wrong and it continued in completely the wrong direction down into the basin to the south. The correct route traverses along the ridge to Sano Jyandan before descending towards the north. As we descended we slowly realised that the road would not be rejoining the correct route, but by the time we fully understood this we had lost significant elevation, and the climb back up to the ridge seemed too far. We continued descending, hoping that the road would eventually lead us west and follow the hillside around towards the north. We realise the road we were on didn't go that way, but a road below us did head that way, so we bushwhacked down to the lower road. This ended up being a major detour and we ended up staying at a homestay at Madre. I have left the route going to Sano Jyandan, but it should be noted that we didn't hike it past this waypoint. The route in the GPX file after this point is just copied from the paper maps, so should not be relied upon."
